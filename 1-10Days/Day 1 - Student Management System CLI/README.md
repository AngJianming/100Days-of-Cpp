# Step-by-Step Guide: Compiling and Running on Bash

## Save the Code
Save the code above into a file with a suitable name. For example, name it `admin.cpp`.

> **Pro tip:** Avoid spaces in filenames. If you must have them, you'll need to wrap the filename in quotes when compiling.

## Open Your Terminal
- **Linux/Mac:** Open the Terminal from your Applications/Utilities.
- **Windows (with Git Bash/Cygwin):** Open your Bash terminal.

## Navigate to the Fileâ€™s Directory
Use the `cd` command to move to the folder where you saved `'Day 1 - Student Management System CLI'`.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/code/directory
```
Replace /path/to/your/code/directory with the actual path.
